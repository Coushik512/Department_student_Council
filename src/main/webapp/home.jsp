      <h2>Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering Department</h2>
      
      <div ><img  src="EIE.png" alt="PTU_png"></div>
    
      <p>Instrumentation is the branch of engineering that deals with measurement, control and automation. In this fully automated world, this course which is a complete blend of technical subjects involving both Electronics and instrumentation areas seems to find its own place in providing the students with adequate knowledge and expertise. Electronics being the order of the day, it is very much necessary for the young minds to get accustomed with the latest developments in Electronics field. Moreover, a combination of Electronics and Instrumentation would fetch high dividends for the students who take up Electronics and Instrumentation as their career course. With the increasing demand for instrumentation engineers, the Department of Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering was started in 1998 and has been producing resourceful engineers for the past twenty years. The department has been accredited by AICTE, New Delhi.

The department has well experienced and highly-motivated faculty members who are specialised in different fields. The department offers UG (B.Tech in EIE), PG (M.Tech in Instrumentation Engineering) and Ph.D. in different areas of Instrumentation such as Biomedical, MEMS, Virtual Instruments and Embedded systems.</p>

      <h2>About PTU</h2>
      
      <p>Puducherry Technological University (PTU) is the first state University of Union Territory of Puducherry.
       It seamlessly came into existence on 5th September 2020 upon the elevation of erstwhile Pondicherry Engineering College - 
       PEC (established in the year 1985 under 
       the 7th five-year plan) with the University status.
        PTU began its journey with a position of pre-eminence and rightly stands as one of the finest engineering schools offering Bachelors,
         Masters and Doctoral study programmes in the prominent disciplines of Engineering/Technology, Science, Management and Entrepreneurship.
          Highly qualified faculty, diverse student population from across the country, best-of-breed infrastructure and an expansive campus sprawling over 185.8 
          acres of luscious green landscape on the shores of tantalizing Bay of Bengal present a vibrant ecosystem for the pursuit of intellectual excellence.
           Thirty-six years on since its original inception, PTU has built a legacy for itself and stands in good stead in terms of discernible 
           academic parameters. NIRF, MHRD, Govt. of India has ranked us at 150 under the category of engineering education.
            PTU alumni are spread far and wide across the globe holding eminent positions in top global Corporates,
             Universities and Civil Services. Some of them own successful enterprises in India and abroad. Such accomplishments
       stand testimony to the quality of education we have been offering from the classrooms of PTU.</p>
